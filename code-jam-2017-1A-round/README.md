Code Jam 2017 - Round 1A
========
My solutions for the problems proposed by Google in the [Round 1A](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/5304486/dashboard) of Code Jam 2017.

I didn't take part in this round because it was from 3:00 to 5:30 am in Italy, so I preferred to sleep :). 
However, I will join the [Round B](https://code.google.com/codejam/schedule) on April 22 and meantime I will try to resolve the problems of round 1A.
